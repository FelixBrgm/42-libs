## The goal of the school
At 42 School, the idea is for you to learn independently by researching and seeking help from your peers. There are no teachers or lectures, but you have a lot of projects to complete in order to advance and graduate. These projects get more challenging as you progress. The primary programming language used is C, and in later stages of the program, you also learn about other topics such as C++, Docker, Virtual Machines, and networking.
